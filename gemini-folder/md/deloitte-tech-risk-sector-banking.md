# Pushing through undercurrents
## Technology's impact on systemic risk: A look at banking

As more financial institutions embrace digital innovation, risks emerge that could threaten the stability of the
financial system. Some of these risks originate from a single sector. Either way, they could proliferate and become
systemic without appropriate management.

To understand what these technology-driven risks look like, the World Economic Forum (the Forum) and Deloitte
consulted over 100 financial services and technology experts in the development of a new report, Pushing
through undercurrents. This group shared more specific perspectives on the forces behind technology-driven
systemic risk in the banking sector. Here's a summary of what we learned. You can learn more in the [full report
from the Forum](https://www.weforum.org/reports/pushing-through-undercurrents-technology-driven-systemic-risk-in-financial-services), and the [executive summary from Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/pushing-through-undercurrents.html).

### Risk 1: Risk exposure from Banking as a Service offerings

#### What could go wrong?

Banking as a service (BaaS) increasingly relies on application programming interfaces, introducing vulnerabilities
that can pose risks for banks. The risk is growing because:

- Customers' sensitive data and funds may be at risk from phishing and social engineering attacks
- Flawed APIs might provide a back door for hackers to penetrate banks' systems
- Noncompliance with data privacy rules by BaaS providers might expose partner banks to reputational risks

This risk could become systemic if, for example, a malicious actor launches a distributed denial-of-service attack on
a BaaS provider, keeping customers from accessing their accounts or making transactions.

# Risk 2: Inadequate stability mechanisms for stablecoin arrangements

What could go wrong?
Stablecoins mimic fiat currencies but without the backing of a central bank, heightening the probability of a run.
The risk is growing because:
• Governance and regulatory gaps could perpetuate illicit activities that might threaten the integrity of the broader
financial system
• The novel technologies used for minting and managing stablecoins are exposed to security risks
• The absence of a stability mechanism like deposit insurance increases the risk of a run

This risk could become systemic if, for example, a significant stablecoin issuer fails to promptly honor large
customer withdrawal requests, touching off a run and eventually collapsing the stablecoin arrangement.

What sectoral and regional
forces could amplify the risk?

How can the industry mitigate it?

|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                  | Standardization and oversight of stablecoin arrangements               | • Requirement for anti-money laundering and "know your customer" processes for stablecoin issuers                                                          |

| • Stringent capital controls, which may encourage individuals in those jurisdictions to park their assets in global stablecoins|                                                        |                                                                                                              |
