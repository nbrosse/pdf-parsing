# Pushing through undercurrents

### **Technology's impact on systemic risk: A look at banking**

As more financial institutions embrace digital innovation, risks emerge that could threaten the stability of the financial system. Some of these risks originate from a single sector. Either way, they could proliferate and become systemic without appropriate management.

To understand what these technology-driven risks look like, the World Economic Forum (the Forum) and Deloitte consulted over 100 financial services and technology experts in the development of a new report, Pushing through undercurrents. This group shared more specific perspectives on the forces behind technology-driven systemic risk in the banking sector. Here's a summary of what we learned. You can learn more in the *[full report](https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/Industries/financial-services/perspectives/pushing-through-undercurrents.html)  [from the Forum, and the executive summary from Deloitte.](https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/Industries/financial-services/perspectives/pushing-through-undercurrents.html)* 

## **Risk 1: Risk exposure from Banking as a Service offerings**

#### **What could go wrong?**

Banking as a service (BaaS) increasingly relies on application programming interfaces, introducing vulnerabilities that can pose risks for banks. The risk is growing because:

- **•** Customers' sensitive data and funds may be at risk from phishing and social engineering attacks
- **•** Flawed APIs might provide a back door for hackers to penetrate banks' systems
- **•** Noncompliance with data privacy rules by BaaS providers might expose partner banks to reputational risks

This risk could become systemic if, for example, a malicious actor launches a distributed denial-of-service attack on a BaaS provider, keeping customers from accessing their accounts or making transactions.

#### **Risk 2: Inadequate stability mechanisms for stablecoin arrangements** ^

#### **What could go wrong?**

Stablecoins mimic fiat currencies but without the backing of a central bank, heightening the probability of a run. The risk is growing because:

- **•** Governance and regulatory gaps could perpetuate illicit activities that might threaten the integrity of the broader financial system
- **•** The novel technologies used for minting and managing stablecoins are exposed to security risks
- **•** The absence of a stability mechanism like deposit insurance increases the risk of a run

This risk could become systemic if, for example, a significant stablecoin issuer fails to promptly honor large customer withdrawal requests, touching off a run and eventually collapsing the stablecoin arrangement.
