# pdf-parsing

This repository provides a comparison of various PDF parsing tools, complementing the blog post [Comparison of PDF parsing options](https://nbrosse.github.io/posts/pdf-parsing/pdf-parsing.html). 
It includes the code and output generated by each tool:

- `marker-pdf-folder`
- `minerU-folder`
- `gemini-folder`
- `llamaparse-folder`
- `docling-folder`

In addition to the tool-specific folders, the repository also includes:

- `pdfs`:  The PDF files used for the comparison.
- `app`:  The code for the Streamlit application used to visualize the results.

To replicate the results within each tool's folder, please install the required Python environment using `uv sync` and follow the detailed instructions provided in the respective `README.md` file.

## Visualizing the Results with the Streamlit App

You can explore the results in two ways:

1. **Hugging Face Space:**  Visit the [PDF parsing demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nicolasb92/pdf-parsing-demo) on Hugging Face Spaces.

2. **Local Streamlit App:**  Run the Streamlit app locally.  Navigate to the `app` folder in your terminal and execute the following commands:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   uv run streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```
