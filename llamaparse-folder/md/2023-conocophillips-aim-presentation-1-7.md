# Cautionary Statement

This presentation provides management's current operational plan for ConocoPhillips over roughly the next decade; for the assets currently in our portfolio, and is subject to multiple assumptions; including, unless otherwise specifically noted:

- an oil price of $60/BBL West Texas Intermediate in 2022 dollars, escalating at 2.25% annually;
- an oil price of $65/BBL Brent in 2022 dollars, escalating at 2.25% annually;
- a gas price of $3.75/MMBTU Henry Hub in 2022 dollars, escalating at 2.25% annually;
- an international gas price of $8/MMBTU Title Transfer Facility & Japan Korea Marker in 2022 dollars, escalating at 2.25% annually;
- cost and capital escalation in line with price escalation; planning case at $60/BBL WTI assumes capital de-escalation from levels observed in 2022;
- all production compound annual growth rates (CAGR) are calculated for the 10-year period 2023-2032;
- inclusion of carbon tax in the cash flow forecasts for assets where a tax is currently assessed. If no carbon tax exists for the asset; it is not included in the cash flow forecasts;
- in the Cost of Supply calculation.

Cost of Supply displayed in WTI, includes carbon tax where carbon policy exists and a proxy carbon price for assets without existing carbon policies. Please refer to the Cost of Supply definition in the Appendix for additional information on how carbon costs are included operating results.
