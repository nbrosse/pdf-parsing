However, the absence of these words does not mean that the statements are not forward-looking:

Where, in any forward-looking statement; the company expresses an expectation or belief as to future results, such expectation or belief is based on management's faith plans and objectives under the assumptions set forth above (unless noted otherwise) and believed to be reasonable as of April 12, 2023, the date of this presentation: These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties and are subject to change as management is continually assessing factors beyond our control that may or may not be currently known: Given the foregoing and the extended time horizon of this presentation; actual outcomes and results will differ from what is expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements; and such differences may be material. Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from what is presented include changes in commodity prices, including prolonged decline in these prices relative to historical or future expected levels; and regional changes in the demand; supply, from a public health crisis or from the imposition or of crude oil production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by OPEC and other producing countries and the resulting company or third-party actions in response to such changes; insufficient liquidity or other factors; such as those listed herein; that could impact our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends such that we suspend our share repurchase program and reduce; suspend, or totally eliminate dividend payments in the future; whether variable or exploratory activities; unexpected cost increases; inflationary pressures or technical difficulties in constructing, maintaining or modifying company facilities; legislative and regulatory initiatives addressing global climate change or other environmental concerns; public health crises, including pandemics (such as COVID-19) and epidemics and any impacts or related company or government policies or actions; investment in and development of competing or alternative energy sources; potential failures or delays in delivering on our current or future low-carbon strategy; including our inability to develop new technologies; disruptions or interruptions impacting the transportation for our oil and gas production; international monetary conditions and exchange rate fluctuations; changes in international trade relationships or governmental policies; including the imposition of price caps or the imposition of trade restrictions or tariffs on any materials or products (such as aluminum and steel) used in the operation of our business; including any sanctions imposed as a result of any ongoing military conflict; including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine; our ability to collect payments when due; including our ability to collect payments from the government of Venezuela or PDVSA; our ability to complete any announced or any future dispositions or acquisitions on time; if at all; the possibility that regulatory approvals for any announced or any future dispositions or acquisitions will not be received on a timely basis, if at all; or that such approvals require modification to the terms of the transactions or our remaining business; business disruptions following any announced or future dispositions or acquisitions; including the diversion of management time and attention; the ability to deploy net proceeds our announced or any future dispositions in the manner and timeframe we of competition and consolidation in the oil and gas industry; limited access to capital or insurance or significantly higher cost of capital or insurance related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets or investor sentiment; general domestic and international economic and political conditions or developments; including as a result of any ongoing conflict; including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine; changes in fiscal regime or tax; environmental and other laws applicable to our business; and disruptions resulting from accidents; extraordinary weather events; civil unrest; political events; war, terrorism; cybersecurity threats or information technology failures; constraints or disruptions; and other economic; business; competitive and/or regulatory factors affecting our business generally as set forth in our with the Securities and Exchange Commission: Unless legally required; ConocoPhillips expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements; whether as a result of new information; future events or otherwise: We assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date and neither future distribution of this material nor the continued availability of this material in archive form on our website should be deemed to constitute an update or re-affirmation of these figures as of any future date future update of these figures will be provided only through a public disclosure indicating that fact. good likely global lifting may from military filings Any

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures; which help facilitate comparison of company operating performance across periods and with peer companies. historical non-GAAP measures included herein will be comparable GAAP financial measures because the information needed to reconcile these measures is dependent on future events; many of which are outside management's control as described above: Additionally, estimating such GAAP measures and providing a meaningful reconciliation consistent with our accounting policies for future periods is extremely difficult and requires a level of precision that is unavailable for these future periods and cannot be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Forward looking non-GAAP measures are estimated consistent with the relevant definitions and assumptions. Any
