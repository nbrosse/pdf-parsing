There should, however, be an expectation that over time, Generative AI, combined with broader AI and data analytical techniques, will play an increasingly dominant role in the tax technology space, fueled by high levels of fluency, an expansion of functionality and, critically, reduced cost of deployment.

Tax directors interviewed for Deloitte’s Tax Transformation Trends research recommend embedding Tax into everyday processes and operations. This will lead to tax considerations in transformation efforts becoming “business as usual,” and making building the business case for technology investment less onerous. ",
