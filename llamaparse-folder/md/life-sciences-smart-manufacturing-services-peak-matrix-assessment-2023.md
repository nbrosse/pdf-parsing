# Life Sciences Smart Manufacturing Services PEAK Matrix® Assessment 2023

# Introduction

Historically, the traditional manufacturing industry was primarily focused on designing standardized manufacturing procedures and managing labor and mechanical systems, but with the emergence of Industry 4.0, technology adoption has become widespread across industries, unlocking numerous benefits. However, the life sciences industry has been slow in adopting technology to modernize manufacturing setups. Nevertheless, the pandemic, regulatory frameworks, and the urge to achieve operational excellence are now driving the adoption of smart manufacturing services.

Life sciences enterprises aim to unlock benefits such as cost optimization, increased productivity, visibility, and efficiency by investing in critical use cases, including digital twins, predictive maintenance, etc. They are also exploring high-growth opportunities such as sustainable manufacturing, batch-to-continuous manufacturing, and manufacturing of personalized medicines.

As the industry experiences investments in smart manufacturing, service providers are taking on the role of end-to-end digital transformation partners by co-developing solutions to assist enterprises in their digital journeys.

In the full report, we present an assessment of 16 life sciences service providers featured on the Life Sciences Smart Manufacturing Services PEAK Matrix® Assessment 2023.

# FAQs

# Does the PEAK Matrix® assessment incorporate any subjective criteria?

Everest Group’s PEAK Matrix assessment takes an unbiased and fact-based approach that leverages provider / technology vendor RFIs and Everest Group’s proprietary databases containing providers’ deals and operational capability information. In addition, we validate/fine-tune these results based on our market experience, buyer interaction, and provider/vendor briefings.

# Is being a Major Contender or Aspirant on the PEAK Matrix, an unfavorable outcome?

No. The PEAK Matrix highlights and positions only the best-in-class providers / technology vendors in a particular space. There are a number of providers from the broader universe that are assessed and do not make it to the PEAK Matrix at all. Therefore, being represented on the PEAK Matrix is itself a favorable recognition.

# What other aspects of the PEAK Matrix assessment are relevant to buyers and providers other than the PEAK Matrix positioning?

A PEAK Matrix positioning is only one aspect of Everest Group’s overall assessment. In addition to assigning a Leader, Major Contender, or Aspirant label, Everest Group highlights the distinctive capabilities and unique attributes of all the providers assessed on the PEAK Matrix. The detailed metric-level assessment and associated commentary are helpful for buyers in selecting providers/vendors for their specific requirements. They also help providers/vendors demonstrate their strengths in specific areas.

# What are the incentives for buyers and providers to participate/provide input to PEAK Matrix research?

- Enterprise participants receive summary of key findings from the PEAK Matrix assessment
- For providers
- The RFI process is a vital way to help us keep current on capabilities; it forms the basis for our database – without participation, it is difficult to effectively match capabilities to buyer inquiries
- In addition, it helps the provider/vendor organization gain brand visibility through being included in our research reports

# What is the process for a provider / technology vendor to leverage its PEAK Matrix positioning?

- Providers/vendors can use their PEAK Matrix positioning or Star Performer rating in multiple ways including:
- Issue a press release declaring positioning; see our citation policies
- Purchase a customized PEAK Matrix profile for circulation with clients, prospects, etc. The package includes the profile as well as quotes from Everest Group analysts, which can be used in PR
- Use PEAK Matrix badges for branding across communications (e-mail signatures, marketing brochures, credential packs, client presentations, etc.)
- The provider must obtain the requisite licensing and distribution rights for the above activities through an agreement with Everest Group; please contact your CD or contact us

# Does the PEAK Matrix evaluation criteria change over a period of time?

PEAK Matrix assessments are designed to serve enterprises’ current and future needs. Given the dynamic nature of the global services market and rampant disruption, the assessment criteria are realigned as and when needed to reflect the current market reality and to serve enterprises’ future expectations.
