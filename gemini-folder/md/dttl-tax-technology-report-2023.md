# Data and new regulations drive tax transformation

Immediate access to reliable, accurate, and fit-for-purpose tax data is essential to be
able to meet complex tax obligations, real-time reporting requirements, and increasing
expectations of tax transparency. Recent developments such as the OECD's Pillar
Two rules, requiring large multinational enterprises to pay a minimum “global tax," the
introduction of CESOP (Central Electronic System of Payment information) and ViDA rules
(VAT in a Digital Age) in the EU, e-reporting, and e-invoicing are all examples of initiatives
which are increasing the compliance requirements for companies and having a significant
impact on tax strategies and operations. Advances in the way technology is used to
identify, transform, and manage tax-related data should be an essential component of
a business's response.

“
Pillar Two is at the forefront of our mind. We
are still quantifying any additional liability and
establishing any impact on our Effective Tax Rate.
Naturally, there is a huge compliance and systems
requirement to accommodate Pillar Two.

Gemma Beck
Head of Tax, Haleon Plc

Challenges such as version control, manual data collection, or getting the right format
and level of data can delay accurate reporting and insights—insights from data being
something the respondents to Deloitte's Tax Transformation Trends 2023 research
highlighted as of high importance. The impact of these regulatory and digitalization
changes can vary across companies based on their size, region, or industry. Yet, the
overall trend has been toward growing workloads and increased complexity.

In addition, many tax authorities are collecting and sharing
more detailed data about taxes and are requesting direct
access to large companies' tax-related data. The digitalization
of tax authorities elevates the need for reliable and automated
tax models, and generating the right data, in the right format,
at the right time. Automating data input, validation, and
cleansing can save time and reduce risk, but is also key to
enabling the access tax administrations increasingly require.

All this at a time when businesses are starting to explore the
role and benefits of Generative Al, and having to evaluate how
trustworthy this technology is, the risks associated with data
privacy, as well as the consequences for their employees.

Technology can also facilitate greater visibility into tax data
across the enterprise, which can provide insights that can
generate value for the business when making strategic
decisions. In short, tax departments increasingly need
technology to help them pivot from task completion and
cost control toward being able to extract outcome-oriented
business insights from compliance activities through analytics.

Yet, when Deloitte asked 300 tax and finance professionals
what progress they had made in implementing tax
transformation strategies, 24% stated they intended to
implement an ERP system customized for tax issues in the next
12 months (Figure 1). Only 37% of respondents said their tax
department had fully implemented the use of tools to monitor
relevant developments in tax laws around the world. Similarly,
many respondents reported that their tax department
had not yet fully implemented the data management and
technology applications required by these changes-
introduction of tax data management solutions and/or having tax
professionals in the company's data management team (38%), and
integrated processes (32%).

Implementing tax technology, or customizing existing ERP systems, requires identifying the appropriate issues to
customize the system for, involving the right stakeholders internally, obtaining budget when there are competing
demands, and devising a robust schedule of maintenance.

# 1. Customizing technology
for global compliance

Compliance is a top priority for the tax department (Figure 2) but to achieve it, comply
with Pillar Two, or calculate their global tax liability, tax departments need accurate,
timely, tax-related data integrated across their organization. However, achieving visibility
into enterprise-wide tax data has proven difficult for many companies, with respondents
to Deloitte's Tax Transformation Trends 2023 survey citing integrating tax-related data
across the company (36%) as their second-most important challenge. More than a fifth of
respondents found challenges in having limited technology or data management expertise
(23%), obtaining a comprehensive view of the total tax paid globally (22%), and not having
sufficient control over technology strategy and investment (22%) (Figure 2). There is a “perfect
storm" with the compliance challenge at least partly linked to these other factors.

[Graph 2: Challenges for the tax department over the next three to five years]
|                        | Percentage |
| ---------------------- | ---------- |
| Complying with evolving tax laws and regulations around the world | 43%        |
| Integrating tax-related data across the company   | 36%        |
| Limited technology/ data management expertise          | 23%        |
| Lack of sufficient control over technology strategy and investment    | 22%        |
| Obtaining a comprehensive view of the total tax paid globally         | 22%        |
| Obtaining adequate budget           | 18%        |
| Difficulty in aligning with company's technology transformation strategy/ approach           | 11%        |

“
What we see now is an increasing demand for
more compliance requirements-I mean from the
OECD and also coming from local authorities...
there's demand for more automation.
Liliane Saiani
Head of Tax, Mercado Libre
"

The desire to continue customizing ERP systems for tax is not surprising-being able to incorporate
flexibility and information to respond to changing tax laws will help companies comply, thereby avoiding
penalties and costs. Modern ERP systems can provide the accurate, granular data that tax teams
need at the legal entity level, while still supporting the management-level reporting needed by other
stakeholders. In this way, the ERP can help support tax analytics so that companies can model the
impact of changing tax laws in multiple jurisdictions, improving the insights used for decision making.

Companies have been working to put in place the data management and technology capabilities
demanded by today's tax environment, but many have more work to do.

“
Our approach was to first work to make ourselves
more efficient. We're trying to transform our ERP
landscape. It's always a challenge to wrangle all
the different technology pieces we have.

# Many of the challenges appear greater for smaller companies than for larger ones. For example, respondents at companies with revenues of US$5 billion or greater were more likely to
say that their company had fully implemented introduction of tax data management solutions and/or having tax professionals in the company's data management team (55%) than did those
at companies with revenues of US$1 billion to US$5 billion (35%) or US$750 million to US$1 billion (25%) (Figure 3).

2. Deciding how to invest
in technology

Digital transformation is embedded into most companies' agendas, but it is still difficult
to identify clear returns on technology investment—from determining which actions
drive the most impact, to which investments yield the highest enterprise value. With
Generative Al also advancing at pace, it is increasingly difficult for businesses to work out
the optimum point at which to invest at scale. When resources are constrained, it is worth
weighing up the investment needed for developing, buying, maintaining, and replacing
technology versus leveraging the technology of an outsource service provider.

“
We outsource as much as possible with trusted
partners. We don't have the resources, nor the
budget, to develop all those tools ourselves.

Respondents to the Tax Transformation Trends 2023 survey cited access to the latest technology capabilities (54%) even more often than reduced operating costs (51%) as a major or
significant benefit of outsourcing (Figure 4). Reduced need for capital investment in technology (45%) was also named frequently as an important benefit. Outsourcing can provide a
strategy for tax departments to acquire the technology tools and expertise that the current environment demands without incurring the significant capital investment that would be
required, upfront and ongoing, if enhancements were developed in-house.

While tax departments may have had discretionary budget for incremental changes, or fixing “broken” systems, wholescale finance transformation has centralized budgets, with IT
taking a prominent role in deciding where transformation efforts will focus. This has led to a greater need for the tax department to collaborate with IT and other departments.

# 3. Internal collaboration
and obtaining budget

Data management and IT applications are increasingly important to tax departments.
However, in Deloitte's Tax Transformation Trends survey, 78% respondents in 2023 said
technology strategy and planning was largely controlled by Finance or IT; 56% said that
the tax department has input into the process, while 22% said it had little input (Figure
5). These findings represent a change from the 2021 survey, in which tax leaders more
often said their departments had control over technology strategy and budget. This may
be due to an increased reliance on ERPs, rather than tax-department specific solutions,
along with the growing need for tax to gather data from across the company-both of
which would put more control into the hands of IT and Finance.

Figure 5. Tax function role in technology strategy and planning

| Feature                                            | 2021 | 2023 |

| Largely set/controlled by Finance or IT, with little input from Tax | 40%  | 7%   |
| Largely set/controlled by Finance or IT, but Tax has input     | 23%  | 15%  |
| Tax has significant autonomy over technology strategy, but limited control over Capex budget | 23%  | 56%  |
| Tax has significant autonomy over both technology strategy and Capex budget | 14%  | 22%  |

Here's the Markdown version of the document:

here were also significant regional differences. Respondents at North American companies (40%) more often said that the tax department has significant autonomy either over
technology strategy or over both technology strategy and budget than did those at companies headquartered in Europe (10%) or Asia Pacific (20%) (Figure 6). European and Asian
companies typically contend with more indirect taxes, requiring complicated integration with supply chain management in ERP systems, led by Finance, while in North America the
emphasis is on income taxes, requiring the tax department to lead. Historically, Asian companies have been geared more toward managing reporting and compliance in multiple
jurisdictions in a decentralized manner, and as a result, were not as experienced in having a common ERP platform to solve all jurisdictional issues. This is, however, changing rapidly as
more tax technology expertise is developing in Asia, enabling common ERP platforms and local customization.

| Largely set/controlled by Finance or IT, but Tax has input | 51%    | 22%           | 51%          |
| Tax has significant autonomy over technology strategy, but limited control over Capex budget   | 29%    | 50%           | 23%          |
| Tax has significant autonomy over both technology strategy and Capex budget | 10%    | 20%           | 3%           |

Technology plays a key role in many aspects of tax operations and in transforming those operations to meet today's challenges—which was made clear in interviews with respondents.

“
It's a priority to meet compliance requirements, which are becoming significantly challenging these days, such as
Pillar Two and e-reporting. All these new kinds of compliance are very connected to technology and digitalization.
Jesus Bravo Fernandez
Head of Indirect Tax, Transfer Pricing, and Tax Technology, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners
"

Many respondents said implementing a single, integrated tax platform was a key priority
for the next few years as they pursue increased efficiency and access to better data. For
many, there is still work to do on rationalizing fragmented technology landscapes.

“
We are looking at how do we deal with all the
various systems, and how do we bring some
structure and consistency and visibility in that
chaos-what evolution and trends are happening
from a technology point of view.
Dirk Timmermans
Vice President of Global Statutory Finance and Tax Operations, Johnson Controls
"
To make the case for budget, tax departments need to demonstrate the value they
generate and protect for the company. Companies that have taken the top-down
company view, managed to explain the impact of tax authority digitalization to the C-suite
and worked collaboratively with the IT department have typically been more successful in
building this value case.

Understanding and communicating the aspiration of real-time compliance through
direct connection between tax authorities and company systems (see the OECD's
“Tax Administration 3.0" discussion paper) is important for ERP system design as ERP
systems are where most transactions are handled-thinking about the long term is
imperative, as finding a point solution now, without thinking through the potential
requirements in five to 10 years' time, may hinder the tax department from creating
the environment that will enable being a strategic advisor to the business. Being able to
identify all the potential outcomes, however, is the difficult part, especially since tax laws
and regulations still differ significantly between jurisdictions and change frequently.

# 4. Finding the optimal
implementation and
maintenance program

Tax departments often focus on immediate-need technology. Best practice, however,
would suggest obtaining budget and developing a road map first to use the technology
already available, identifying what might be needed in the future, and then making build-
or-buy decisions. At this point, it's useful to have a holistic view of the tax department's
operating model—it's not about doing everything now, but looking at increasing speed
and accuracy, and freeing up tax professionals for more strategic business activity.

Once the technology is chosen, the question is often whether to implement using
internal resources, appoint an implementation partner, or outsource the entire function
requiring the technology.

If the decision is made to use in-house resources, tax departments need to develop
professional teams with the new skills required, especially data management and
technology expertise. This was evident from Deloitte's Tax Transformation Trends
research in 2023: When asked where their tax department will have the greatest need
for skills over the next three to five years, respondents most often named data analytics,
data-driven strategic insights, and data management (44%)—a reflection of the growing
importance of data-driven decision making and increased government requirements for
direct access to companies' tax data (Figure 7 on the next page).

“
We made the strategic decision to have capable IT
people within our tax department many years ago,
and that has allowed us to move much more quickly
with getting our data needs met.
Dirk Timmermans
Vice President of Global Statutory Finance and Tax Operations, Johnson Controls
"

Several skill areas were cited less often in 2023 than in 2021, suggesting that some companies may have made progress in addressing their talent requirement in those areas—either
through recruitment, or by leaning more on outside providers. For example, technology transformation and process redesign was named as a top talent need by 29% of respondents
in the current survey, compared to 43% in 2021. However, this area still ranked fourth highest among the skills needed in the next few years, indicating that many companies are still
working to develop or acquire technology talent.

# What's next?

Strategic management and effective use of data as an asset will be top of mind for tax leaders as
both global tax reform and primary stakeholders—including boards, finance functions, and financial
institutions-continue to place data management at the center of the tax function. The tax technology
landscape, however, is broader than ERP and identifying tax data-tax leaders also need to consider
how many technologies are really needed to meet their needs, how many are not yet connected to
each other, and how fast technology is changing, threatening the obsolescence of existing systems.

The pace at which Generative Al technology and tooling is advancing can make it difficult for
businesses to work out the optimum point at which to invest at scale. Generative Al activity is
currently predominantly focused on identifying use cases and undertaking a tactical program of
experimentation as part of a measured approach to understanding the role and impact Generative
Al can have on a variety of business functions. There should, however, be an expectation that
over time, Generative Al, combined with broader Al and data analytical techniques, will play an
increasingly dominant role in the tax technology space, fueled by high levels of fluency, an expansion
of functionality and, critically, reduced cost of deployment. All of which reinforces the need for a clear
strategy and focus on data structures.

Today, tax directors are addressing the impact of data within their tax functions and have pivoted
by introducing new skill sets within their tax function, which is encouraging. This is, however,
just the first step of a continuous journey in which primary stakeholders use tax data through
analytics as a strategic enabler to drive investment decisions, often these days using dynamic
dashboarding and modeling.

The results of Deloitte's Tax Transformation Trends 2023 survey highlighted the need for data-
driven insight from compliance activities, more agile partnering with other parts of the business,
and a heightened need to integrate technology across functions and jurisdictions. As digitalization
continues-accelerated by the introduction of Artificial Intelligence capabilities—tax departments will
need to ensure their digital strategy meets an ever-changing tax regulatory landscape, is incorporated
into and aligns with the business's overall digital transformation ambitions, and incorporates efforts
to prepare their people and processes for accelerated transformation. Tax directors interviewed for
Deloitte's Tax Transformation Trends research recommend embedding Tax into everyday processes
and operations. This will lead to tax considerations in transformation efforts becoming “business as
usual," and making building the business case for technology investment less onerous.
